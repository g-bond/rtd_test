read_the_docs_test documentation
================================

Add your content using ``reStructuredText`` syntax. See the
`reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_
documentation for details.

Steps towards completion :
   Figure out docstrings for Python scripts.
   Figure out sphinx-rst methods for ReadTheDocs (splitting, structuring, grouping)
      This step is a bit of 'play' to figure out your options on breaking things up easily.
   Merge function docstrings into ReadTheDocs test environment
   Get your current code into a dedicated github repo independent of the Notebooks
      Tests to verify that everything is still functioning properly between updates
   Add getTracesDffv2 to the codebase
   Get DeepInterpolation 0.2.0 running on new workstations, benchmark.
   Finalize access method (depends on swift OIT response, jumpbox or LinVPN)
